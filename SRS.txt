CONTEXT:
In this exemplar, interview goals specific to the app were defined. In this case, the goals were to learn more about the challenges people experience while trying to manage a busy schedule and meal planning, as well as some of the frustrations they experience while ordering from a restaurant. Understanding these goals going into the interview helped researchers understand the needs and struggles of the users the app is targeting. 

When choosing participants to interview, certain participant characteristics were identified to help ensure a representative sample was interviewed. For this example, the participant who was interviewed was Reena, a 37-year-old paramedic from a suburb near Denver, Colorado who eats out several nights a week and has a busy schedule. For your participants, itâ€™s important to include a diverse but targeted group of users when conducting interviews in order to get the best data. 

For the Pizza app, the ideal participants were people of different abilities and genders who are between the ages of 18 and 62, order food from restaurants at least once a week, and reside in metropolitan or suburban areas.
